// ************ Real Time User Verifier Video KYC Architecture *******************

Case: User opens early, verifier late

User opens URL
→ GET session (pending)
→ subscribes to channel
→ waiting UI

Verifier joins session
→ VerifierJoined event
→ UI updates

User clicks "Start KYC"
→ UserJoined event
→ verifier notified
→ video can start



Case: Verifier opens first, user late

Verifier joins
→ waiting UI

User opens URL later
→ GET session (in_progress)
→ subscribes to channel
→ sees "Verifier waiting"

User clicks "Start KYC"
→ UserJoined event
→ both ready


🧠 Presence ≠ forever

Presence is temporary.

If:

tab closes

internet drops

browser crashes

Presence must be lost.

Later we’ll handle:

disconnects

reconnects

grace periods



//***************************

🧠 6. Event naming suggestion (for clarity)

To avoid confusion later, I strongly recommend:

Purpose	Event name
Assignment	VerifierAssigned
Verifier presence	VerifierJoinedSession
User presence	UserJoinedSession
