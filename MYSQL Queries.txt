SQL joins is used to combine rows from two or more tables


Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table



// INNER JOIN SQL QUERY

SELECT employees.first_name,employees.last_name,employees.email,departments.department_name FROM employees INNER JOIN
departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;


Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_nam

SELECT Products.ProductID, Products.ProductName, Categories.CategoryName
FROM Products
INNER JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID;

SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword
The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matching records from the right table (table2). The result is 0 records from the right side, if there is no match.

LEFT JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;

SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword
The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matching records from the left table (table1). The result is 0 records from the left side, if there is no match.

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
FROM Orders
RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;


SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword
The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

SQL QUERY

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
FROM Customers
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;


//******************************************************************

SQL Self Join
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

Self Join Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;


The SQL UNION Operator
The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

The UNION operator automatically removes duplicate rows from the result set.


Requirements for UNION:

Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
UNION Syntax


SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

SELECT City FROM Customers
UNION
SELECT City FROM Suppliers
ORDER BY City;

SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT department_name FROM departments;

SELECT first_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT department_name FROM departments;

The UNION ALL operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

The UNION ALL operator includes all rows from each statement, including any duplicates.


SQL GROUP BY STATEMENT

GROUP BY Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;


SELECT COUNT(employee_id),department_id
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;



SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;


SELECT COUNT(employees.employee_id) AS total_employees,departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id GROUP BY departments.department_id;


The SQL HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.


HAVING Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);



SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;




SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;



The SQL EXISTS Operator
The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.

EXISTS Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);


SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);

CREATE DATABASE databasename;
DROP DATABASE databasename;
BACKUP DATABASE databasename
TO DISK = 'filepath';


CREATE INDEX Syntax
Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:

CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON Persons (LastName);

CREATE INDEX idx_pname
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName);

DROP INDEX Statement
The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.

MS Access:

DROP INDEX index_name ON table_name;


ALTER TABLE - ADD Column
To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:

ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;


ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255);

ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;

ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;

ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
